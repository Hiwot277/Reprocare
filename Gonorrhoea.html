                <p>Gonorrhoea is normally passed on through unprotected sex . Many people, especially women, do not experience any symptoms.  

<br>It is easily treated, usually with a single antibiotic injection. Left untreated it can cause infertility or other serious long-term health problems.

                    <h3>How do I prevent Gonorrhoea?</h3>
                    <p>Gonorrhoea cannot always be prevented, but if you're sexually active you can reduce your risk by practising safer sex. <br>

<br>Using new condoms and dental dams correctly every time you have sex is the best way to prevent syphilis. Remember that the condom or dental dam must cover any sores or rashes or you won’t be protected. 

<br>Having regular STI tests is one of the best ways to look after your sexual health. If you are having sex with multiple partners, it’s even more important to use condoms and get tested regularly even if you don’t have any symptoms.  

<br>It’s also important that you’re able to talk about your sexual health with your partner/s. This way you can let each other know about any symptoms or infections, and discuss how you will have safer sex together.  </p>
               
                    <h3>What are the symptoms of Gonorrhoea?</h3>
                    <p>   What are the symptoms of gonorrhoea?
Many people who have gonorrhoea do not notice any symptoms. If you do get symptoms these usually appear within 10 days of infection, but they can also develop months later. 

Gonorrhoea symptoms in women include: 

unusual green or yellow discharge from the vagina which may be thin or watery 

pain or burning when urinating (peeing) 

pain in the lower abdomen – this is less common 

bleeding between periods and/or heavier period and bleeding after sex – this is less common.

                    <h3>Gonorrhoea symptoms in men include: </h3>
                    <p>  Syphilis can be cured with antibiotics.However, it’s important that you get tested and treated early on, as some health problems caused by late-stage syphilis can’t be resolved. 

<br>The specific antibiotics used to treat syphilis may vary depending on where you are.  

<br>Don’t have sex or close body contact with other people until you and your current sexual partner(s) have finished your treatment. You will need to be checked by a healthcare professional to make sure the infection has cleared. 

<br>Remember, having been treated for syphilis previously does not make you immune. You can still get syphilis again.
unusual discharge from the penis that may be white, yellow or green in colour 

pain or burning when urinating (peeing) 

inflammation or swelling of the foreskin 

pain in the testicles – this is rare. 

You can also get gonorrhoea in your anus (bottom), eyes or throat. If infected semen or vaginal fluid comes into contact with the eyes, you can develop conjunctivitis. 

Both women and men can experience irritation, pain, swelling or discharge in the anus or the eyes. Gonorrhoea in the throat doesn’t normally have any symptoms.
