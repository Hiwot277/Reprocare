                    <h3>How do I prevent syphilis?</h3>
                    <p>Syphilis cannot always be prevented, but if you're sexually active you can reduce your risk by practising safer sex. <br>

<br>Using new condoms and dental dams correctly every time you have sex is the best way to prevent syphilis. Remember that the condom or dental dam must cover any sores or rashes or you won’t be protected. 

<br>You should avoid sharing sex toys and if you do share them, wash them and cover them with a new condom before each use. 

<br>Having regular STI tests is one of the best ways to look after your sexual health. If you are having sex with multiple partners, it’s even more important to use condoms and get tested regularly even if you don’t have any symptoms.  

<br>It’s also important that you’re able to talk about your sexual health with your partner/s. This way you can let each other know about any symptoms or infections, and discuss how you will have safer sex together.  </p>
                
        
            
                    <h3>What are the symptoms of syphilis?</h3>
                    <p>   Symptoms of syphilis are often mild and it is easy to pass on the infection without knowing you have it. Many people with syphilis won't notice any symptoms for years. 

<br>Without treatment a syphilis infection develops through different stages. It can become more serious, spreading to other parts of the body.  </p>
                
			<br><h4>Early symptoms </h4> 	<p>The first symptoms of syphilis usually develop around 2 or 3 weeks after infection. The first thing a person may notice is a painless sore (called a chancre) - usually around their anus or genitals. Not everyone experiences this symptom. Chancres normally heal by themselves within 2 to 8 weeks, but without treatment the infection may progress to a second stage.</p>
			<br><h4>Later symptoms </h4><p>A few weeks after the early symptoms have passed, you might start to feel ill. Later symptoms include a fever, headache or swollen glands. You may also notice weight loss or small skin growths (similar to genital warts) around your anus or genitals. Some people get blotchy red rashes on their body, often on the palms of their hands or soles of their feet. 	
		<br>	<h4>Latent stage </h4><p>After this, a person may live with syphilis for years without any signs of infection. This is known as ‘latent syphilis’ and can last for decades. If syphilis is left undiagnosed and untreated, the infection will go on to cause serious health problems. </p>

                    <h3>How is syphilis treated?</h3>
                    <p>  Syphilis can be cured with antibiotics. However, it’s important that you get tested and treated early on, as some health problems caused by late-stage syphilis can’t be resolved. 

<br>The specific antibiotics used to treat syphilis may vary depending on where you are.  

<br>Don’t have sex or close body contact with other people until you and your current sexual partner(s) have finished your treatment. You will need to be checked by a healthcare professional to make sure the infection has cleared. 

<br>Remember, having been treated for syphilis previously does not make you immune. You can still get syphilis again. </p>
