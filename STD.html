      <h1>What are STDs? </h1>Sexually transmitted diseases (STDs), also known as sexually transmitted infections (STIs), are very common. STDs pass from one person to another through vaginal, oral, and anal sex.
<br> <br>Sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) are infections that are spread through sexual contact. The symptoms of STDs vary depending on the type of infection. Some common symptoms include sores or bumps on the genitals , painful or burning urination, discharge from the penis or vagina, unusual vaginal bleeding, pain during sex, and sore, swollen lymph nodes. 
<br> <br>It is important to note that some STDs may not show any symptoms at all. <span id= "dots">...</span> <span id="more" >If you think you may have an STD or have been exposed to one, it is important to get tested and treated as soon as possible
<br> <br>Some STDs can be passed from a pregnant person to the baby, either during pregnancy or when giving birth. Other ways that STDs may be spread include during breastfeeding, through blood transfusions, or by sharing needles.
<b> <br> <br>How are sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) diagnosed?</b> <br>
If you are sexually active, you should talk to your health care provider about your risk for STDs and whether you need to be tested. This is especially important since many STDs do not usually cause symptoms.
 <br> 
Some STDs may be diagnosed during a physical exam or through microscopic examination of a sore or fluid swabbed from the vagina, penis, or anus. Blood tests can diagnose other types of STDs. </p>
<b>What are the treatments for sexually transmitted diseases (STDs)? </b> <br>
Antibiotics can treat STDs caused by bacteria or parasites. There is no cure for STDs caused by viruses, but medicines can often help with the symptoms and lower your risk of spreading the infection.
 <br>
Correct usage of latex condoms greatly reduces, but does not completely eliminate, the risk of catching or spreading STDs. The most reliable way to avoid infection is to not have anal, vaginal, or oral sex.
 <br>
There are vaccines to prevent HPV and hepatitis B.
