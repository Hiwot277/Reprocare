        <BR><br><br><br> <BR><p ><b><h1> MENOPAUSE </p ></b></h1>
Menopause is the time that marks the end of your menstrual cycles. It's diagnosed after you've gone 12 months without a menstrual period. Menopause can happen in your 40s or 50s, but the average age is 51 in the United States.
<br><br><br><span id="dots">...</span> <span id="more">
Menopause is a natural biological process. But the physical symptoms, such as hot flashes, and emotional symptoms of menopause may disrupt your sleep, lower your energy or affect emotional health. There are many effective treatments available, from lifestyle adjustments to hormone therapy.
<h2><b>Symptoms</h2> </b><br><br>
In the months or years leading up to menopause (perimenopause), you might experience these signs and symptoms:
<br><br>
Irregular periods<br><br>
Vaginal dryness<br><br>
Hot flashes<br><br>
Chills<br><br>
Night sweats<br><br>
Sleep problems<br><br>
Mood changes<br><br>
Weight gain and slowed metabolism<br>
<br>Thinning hair and dry skin<br>
<br>Loss of breast fullness<br>
<br>Signs and symptoms, including changes in menstruation can vary among women. Most likely, you'll experience some irregularity in your periods before they end.
<br><br>
Skipping periods during perimenopause is common and expected. Often, menstrual periods will skip a month and return, or skip several months and then start monthly cycles again for a few months. Periods also tend to happen on shorter cycles, so they are closer together. Despite irregular periods, pregnancy is possible. If you've skipped a period but aren't sure you've started the menopausal transition, consider a pregnancy test.
<br><br><br>
<h2><b>When to see a doctor</h2></b>
Keep up with regular visits with your doctor for preventive health care and any medical concerns. Continue getting these appointments during and after menopause.
<br><br>
Preventive health care as you age may include recommended health screening tests, such as colonoscopy, mammography and triglyceride screening. Your doctor might recommend other tests and exams, too, including thyroid testing if suggested by your history, and breast and pelvic exams.
<br><br>
Always seek medical advice if you have bleeding from your vagina after menopause
