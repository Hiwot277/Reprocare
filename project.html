        <p >What is pregnancy? Pregnancy is the time during which one or more offspring develops inside a woman's uterus.<span id="dots">...</span> <span id="more"> A multiple pregnancy involves more than one offspring, such as with twins.  
<br> <br>Pregnancy is a state in which a woman carries a fertilized egg inside her body. 
<br> <br>The first sign of pregnancy is usually a missed menstrual period, although some women bleed in the beginning. A woman's breasts swell and may become tender as the mammary glands prepare for eventual breastfeeding. Nipples begin to enlarge and the veins over the surface of the breasts become more noticeable.
<br> <br>Nausea and vomiting are very common symptoms and are usually worse in the morning and during the first trimester of pregnancy. They are usually caused by hormonal changes, in particular, increased levels of progesterone. Women may feel worse when their stomach is empty, so it is a good idea to eat several small meals throughout the day, and to keep things like crackers on hand to eat even before getting out of bed in the morning.<br>
 <br><BR>Pregnancy is broken into three time periods, called trimesters. Most women feel differently, both physically and mentally, during each trimester. In addition to weight and body shape, other alterations in your body chemistry and function also take place during pregnancy. Your heart works harder, your temperature registers slightly higher, body secretions increase, joints and ligaments are more flexible and hormones are altered.
<br> <br><br><BR>Mood changes also are common, resulting from a combination of hormonal changes and greater fatigue, as well as normal anxiety over body image, sexuality, finances, partner roles and impending parenthood.
<br> <br><br><BR>For the vast majority of women, pregnancy follows a fairly routine course. Some women, however, have complications or challenges related to their health or the health of their baby. These women experience what is called a high-risk pregnancy.
