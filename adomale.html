<h1>  the first sign of adolescence in male  </h1>
<p>
In males, the earliest signs of puberty are the growth of the testicles, then the penis. The skin that surrounds the testicles, called the scrotum, becomes thinner and redder.<br><br>

Body hair begins to grow, typically on the face, chest, armpits, back, and pubic area. Some people start shaving, and this can cause a rash, especially on sensitive skin. Using shaving foam or gel can help, and using an electric razor can reduce the risk of cuts.<br><br>

Meanwhile, the voice starts to get lower and deeper as the voice box, or larynx, grows. A person’s voice may crack sometimes. This is normal and goes away over time. The Adam’s apple, which is the visible bump in the throat, may get bigger.<br><br>

Some males also experience swelling around their nipples during puberty. This usually goes away. In around half of males, it can last a few months or a few years.<br><br>
