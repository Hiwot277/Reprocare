 <h1> Services for men </h1>
<p align="center">What is striking is that—at least in their teen and young-adult years—few of men's sexual and reproductive health needs require medical intervention per se, with the exception of STD screening and treatment.<br> Instead, younger men primarily need information, counseling and skills-building services that can help them to resist peer pressure; make informed, positive decisions; take responsibility for their actions; and communicate effectively with their partners about personal and sexual matters.<br> <br>As men grow older, they are more likely to need medical reproductive health care, such as infertility services, vasectomy, and diagnosis and treatment for cancers of the reproductive tract. However, the situation would change radically with the introduction of a new male contraceptive or prophylactic method that requires medical attention.
