        <p ><b><h1>The three trimesters</h1></b>
        <p>Pregnancy has three trimesters, each of which is marked by specific fetal developments<br>. A pregnancy is considered full-term at 40 weeks; infants delivered before the end of week 37 are considered premature. Premature infants may have problems with their growth and development, as well as difficulties in breathing and digesting.<div><span id="dots">...</span> <span id="more">
<br> <br> The first trimester(0 to 13weeks)  is the most crucial to your baby's development. During this period, your baby's body structure and organ systems develop. Most miscarriages and birth defects occur during this period.
<br> <br> The second trimester(14 to 26 weeks) of pregnancy is often called the "golden period" because many of the unpleasant effects of early pregnancy disappear. During the second trimester, you're likely to experience decreased nausea, better sleep patterns and an increased energy level. However, you may experience a whole new set of symptoms, such as back pain, abdominal pain, leg cramps, constipation and heartburn.
<br> <br> Somewhere between 16 weeks and 20 weeks, you may feel your baby's first fluttering movements.	    

      <br><br> <br> once you have reached the third trimester(27 to 40 weeks)You have now reached your final stretch of pregnancy and are probably very excited and anxious for the<br> birth of your baby. Some of the physical symptoms you may experience during<br> this period include shortness of breath, hemorrhoids, urinary incontinence, varicose veins and sleeping problems. Many of these symptoms arise from the increase in the size of your uterus, which expands from approximately 2 ounces before pregnancy to 2.5 pounds at the time of birth.
<br> <br> A pregnant women with any of the following signs should contact her doctor immediately:
       <ul type="circle" style= "text-align:left">
 <li>abdominal pain</li>
 <li>rupture of the amniotic sac or leaking of fluid from the vagina</li>
 <li>bleeding from the vagina</li>
 <li>no fetal movement for 24 hours (after the fifth month)</li>
 <li>continuous headaches</li>
 <li>marked, sudden swelling of eyelids, hands, or face during the last three months</li>
 <li>dim or blurry vision during last three months</li>
 <li>persistent vomiting</li>
